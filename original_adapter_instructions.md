I have this OpenSCAD file for a fan adapter. It takes a 120mm noctua PC fan and adapts it to exhaust through a ~50mm hole at the top of a cabinet. The adapter will need to be screwed up from inside the adapter into the ceiling.  Unfortunately the hole is very near a wall (it turns out the edge of the hole is only about 9/32" away from a metal bracket attached to the wall in one dimension) so the fan has to be offset from the air hole. In the end we need the fan to be almost flush with the wall, and one side of the adapter has to be almost straight vertically up against the wall, then the other side is sloped to accomodate the offset.

I have now taken some more clear measurements and have some tweaks to make.

One big tweak is that on one side I need to make a hole in the adapter to accomodate passing two cables through the fan outlet.

* Fan Screw holes roughly right size, put in m4 heat set nuts. Those are 6mm hole diameter (with a slight taper at the top), the nut will be 4mm deep but the hole should be a little deeper so like 5 or 6mm?
* Wood screw holes need to build up a little countersink to rest against. #8 wood screws, Head Diameter 0.332"; Head Height 0.1"; shaft diameter 0.164"
* Actual fan inner diameter is about 115-116.
* Cable that needs to go through adapter sidewall is 20mm
* Output air is like 53mm
* From wall is like 12/32”
* From that metal bracket is 9/32”. 
* 65+mm from left wall so almost no offset in the other dimension needed?
* only 3 top screws, since on one side it's so close to the wall at the offset it's hard to get a screw in.
* Increase the resolution of the circles, so they look smoother


So please remember the physical requirements of the screws and nuts and how they have to attach. Consider the design which is mostly working, and make the necessary changes.
